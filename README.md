### 2. Requirements:

* **Bagisto**: v2.3.x

---

### 3. Installation:

#### Step 1: Install via Composer

```bash
composer require bagisto/b2b-suite:dev-master
```

### 2. Register the Service Provider

In `bootstrap/providers.php`:

> **Note:** Autoloading via Composer’s package auto-discovery is **not possible** for this provider. The registry order matters—`B2BSuiteServiceProvider` must be listed **after** the Shop package or at the end of the providers array. Auto-discovery would load it too early, which can cause issues.

```php
'providers' => [
    Webkul\B2BSuite\Providers\B2BSuiteServiceProvider::class,
],
```

#### Step 3: Run the installation command

```bash
php artisan b2b-suite:install
```

> That’s it! The package is now installed and ready to use in your Bagisto project.
